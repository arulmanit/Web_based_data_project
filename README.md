# Web_based_data_project

We are supposed to propose a applied public health solution through call data records from D4D challenge (https://datacollaboratives.org/cases/orange-telecom-data-for-development-challenge-d4d.html)


Our objectives are :

1.To find the spatial association between the population density and distance of Senegal regions over the years;

2.To find the spatial temporal variation in people movement over the different quarters of the year 2013-14;

3.To create a trajectory model showing human movement across the Senegal region through call detail record data (CDR) using previously established methodologies.
